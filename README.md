# RULA_machine
### Introduction
This code intends to estimate RULA from 2-D pose. The training and testing data used poses from human 3.6.
### Usage
The train.py can do the training and testing (using keras). And the m files contain functions for loading all human 3.6 poses (you need register and download the raw cdf files first from http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php), and functions for calculating RULA.
